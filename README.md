This program makes it possible to go through a list of websites and update the status if the websites haven't been checked for a certain period of time

In order to run this program you need to:
- download two .java files that are located in this folder
- compile them in Command Line or Power Shell by typing "javac <fileName>.java"
- run DBConnection by typing "java DBConnection"
  
  I used MySQL while coding, the database name is **testDB**, the table with the websites info is called **websitebase**
  The date I compared to was 31.12.2018
